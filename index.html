            I want to inform you that whenever
            you use my Service, in a case of an error in the
            app I collect data and information (through third

            may include information such as your device Internet
            Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system
            version, the configuration of the app when utilizing

        </p>
        <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
        <p>
            Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
            commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are
            sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and
            are stored on your device's internal memory.
        </p>
        <p>
            This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly.
            However, the app may use third party code and libraries that
            use “cookies” to collect information and improve their
            services. You have the option to either accept or refuse
            these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your

        <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p>
        <p>
            I may employ third-party companies
            and individuals due to the following reasons:

            I want to inform users of this
            Service that these third parties have access to your
            Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks
            assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated
            not to disclose or use the information for any other
            purpose.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
        <p>
            I value your trust in providing us
            your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use
            commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember
            that no method of transmission over the internet, or method
            of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and
            I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

            on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site.
            Note that these external sites are not operated by
            me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to

            I do not knowingly collect personally
            identifiable information from children under 13. In the case
            I discover that a child under 13 has provided
            me with personal information,
            I immediately delete this from our servers. If you
            are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child
            has provided us with personal information, please contact
            me so that I will be able to do
